## Details

Covid dataset was relatively easy to analyze as it didn't require cleaing, was already ready to use one. I analyzed the data for:
<li> Countries which has the most cases/recoveries/deaths/actives cases.
<li> Covid trends for the entire world (e.g. when deaths peaked/ total cases decreased etc) 
<li> The most effected countries.
<li> Cases per country in different categories and top 20 countries in those categories, for example:
