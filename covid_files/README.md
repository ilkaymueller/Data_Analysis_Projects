## Introduction
An EDA project to anaylze the Covid19 data per country.

## Process and Libraries
### Process
All files for the data were in csv format. I analyzed the data with Python in Jupyter Notebook.
 <li> 1.Data collected from Kaggle
 <li>2.Data Exploring/ Cleaning üîç
 <li>3.Data Transformation üì¶
 <li>4.Analyzing the data ‚ö°Ô∏è
 <li>5.Visualisation üìä
 <li>6. Interpretation of the results üß†

### Libraries
During the analysis, i used following libraries:

<li>Numpy
<li>Pandas
<li>Matplotlib
<li>Seaborn
<li>Geopy
<li>Scipy
<li>Plotly
<li>Folium
<li>h3-py

## Details

After cleaning and transforming the data, analyzed the dataset for the following questions:
<li> Which month has the most pickups? To find out the best season for Uber.
<li> On which day/hour is the busiest? Here I tried to find the rush hour of the New York City. For that, also binned the hours for every 15 minutes to have a better understanding.
<li>Detecting the trends as daywise and weekwise.
<li> Pairwise analysis for day and hour togetger.
<li> Automating the pairwise analysis for the next pairs.

## Geospatial Analysis

<li>Created an interactive map to show rush locations on map using Folium.
<li> In the Choropleth notebook, created a Choropleth hexagon map using geojson and h3-py.
