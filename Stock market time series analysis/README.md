## Introduction
Stock market time series analysis with more than 500 datasets. 

## Process and Libraries
### Process
Data analyzed with Python in Jupyter Notebook. Used 'glob' to read all the files.
 <li> 1.Data collected online.
 <li>2.Data Exploring/Cleaning üîç
 <li>3.Data Transformation üì¶
 <li>4.Analyzing the data ‚ö°Ô∏è
 <li>5.Visualisation üìä
 <li>6. Interpretation of the results üß†

### Libraries
During the analysis, I used following libraries:

<li>Numpy
<li>Pandas
<li>Matplotlib
<li>Seaborn
<li>Plotly

Time Series Analysis for stock market prices. Sampled the 4 big companies' prices(Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amazon) to work with smaller data (due to cpu restrictions:)) 
<li> Calculated the mean prices of certain time windows(10,20,50 following days) using 'rolling' function.
<li> Comparison of closure prices for the specified time windows per company. Looks like this via Matplotlib:

<li> Daily returns of Apple stocks and resampling the Apple data montly and yearly basis to have more insights to detect the trends.

<li> Checking the correlation between the closing prices of these 4 companies and used the basic map below to build further graphs.

<li> Price change compare to previous day and final closing price for the day is correlated or not using pairgrid from seaborn.
